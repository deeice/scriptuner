![Get Playlist Script](doc/getpls.png?raw=true)

Right now there's some half baked ideas and a small script that uses dialog to browse for playlists on a local node.js server.  That works great when I wanna play an album from my collection on the laptop.  But I want to hear it on the zipit and would rather not get up, so I do it via the ssh client the chromebook.

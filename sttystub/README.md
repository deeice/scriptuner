This is a stub stty program for those rare occurances where you have nothing.  The current openwrt-zipit squashfs is one such case.  It doesn't even have busybox stty.  So this stub has only the minimum functionality required to support the stty commands in the fsel script.  It can disable the keyboard echo and then turn it back on at the end.  That's about it, but it compiles down to about 2.5K with aggressive strip options.
